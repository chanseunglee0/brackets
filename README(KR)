브라켓스에 오신 것을 환영합니다!
-------------------

브라켓스는 HTML, CSS 및 JavaScript로 작성된 현대적인 오픈소스 코드 편집기입니다.

브라켓스를 다른 웹 코드 편집기와 다르게 만드는 특징은 무엇인가요?

* **도구가 방해되지 않아요.** 많은 패널과 아이콘으로 코딩 환경을 난잡하게 만드는 대신, 브라켓스의 퀵 에딧 UI는 문맥별 코드와 도구를 인라인으로 제공합니다.
* **브라우저와 동기화돼요.** 라이브 프리뷰를 통해 브라켓스는 브라우저와 직접 연동되어 코드 수정 사항을 즉시 반영하고, 원본 소스 코드와 브라우저 뷰 사이를 쉽게 이동할 수 있습니다.
* **스스로 만들어요.** 브라켓스는 오픈 소스로 제공되며, HTML, CSS 및 JavaScript로 구축되어 웹을 위한 최고의 코드 편집기를 함께 만들 수 있습니다. [도움을 줄 수 있어요](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

브라켓스는 이미 버전 1에 도달했지만, 여기서 멈추지 않아요. 우리는 [트렐로 보드](http://bit.ly/BracketsTrelloBoard)에 많은 기능 아이디어가 있으며, 브라켓스에 추가하고자 하는 혁신적인 웹 개발 워크플로도 준비 중이에요. 따라서 브라켓스를 시도해보시고 어떻게 하면 여러분의 최애 편집기로 만들 수 있을지 알려주세요.

How to install and run Brackets
-------------------------------
#### Download

Installers for the latest stable build for Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) can be [downloaded here](http://brackets.io/).

#### Usage

By default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple "Getting Started" content.
You can choose a different folder to edit using *File > Open Folder*.

Most of Brackets should be pretty self-explanatory, but for information on how
to use its unique features, like Quick Edit and Live Preview, please read
[How to Use Brackets](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets). 
Also, see the [release notes](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Release-Notes)
for a list of new features and known issues in each build.

In addition to the core features built into Brackets, there is a large and growing
community of developers building extensions that add all sorts of useful functionality.
See the [Brackets Extension Registry](https://registry.brackets.io/)
for a list of available extensions. For installation instructions,
see the [extensions wiki page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions).

#### Need help?

you to fix common problems and find extra help if needed.

Helping Brackets
----------------

#### I found a bug!

If you found a repeatable bug, and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting) 
tips didn't help, then be sure to [search existing issues](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues) first.
Include steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, and your OS and
Brackets version number. Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.
[Read more guidelines for filing good bugs.](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)


#### I have a new suggestion, but don't know how to program!

For feature requests please first check our [Trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog) to
see if it's already there; you can upvote it if so. If not, feel free to file it as an issue as above; we'll
move it to the feature backlog for you.


#### I want to help with the code!

Awesome! _There are lots of ways you can help._ First read 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), 
then learn how to [pull the repo and hack on Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets).

The text editor inside Brackets is based on 
[CodeMirror](http://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror)&mdash;thanks to Marijn for
taking our pull requests, implementing feature requests and fixing bugs! See 
[Notes on CodeMirror](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Notes-on-CodeMirror)
for info on how we're using CodeMirror.

Although Brackets is built in HTML/CSS/JS, it currently runs as a desktop 
application in a thin native shell, so that it can access your local files.
(If you just try to open the index.html file in a browser, it won't work yet.)
The native shell for Brackets lives in a separate repo, 
[adobe/brackets-shell](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/).


I want to keep track of how Brackets is doing!
----------------------------------------------

Not sure you needed the exclamation point there, but we like your enthusiasm.
